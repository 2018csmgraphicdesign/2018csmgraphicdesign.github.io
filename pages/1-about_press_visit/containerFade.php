    <p class="about-text">At CSM we think innovation, invention and beauty arrive out of play, form-making, material exploration and improvisation as much as they emerge from conceptual thinking and library research. The poet Stéphane Mallarmé was supposed to have said to the painter Edgar Degas, “poems are not made with ideas, they are made with words.” We might add that graphic design is not just made with ideas but with situations and materials. </p>
