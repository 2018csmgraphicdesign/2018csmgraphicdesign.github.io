I have the ambition to merge this gab between graphic design and spacial installations by developing a meaningful interplay between people, technology, data systems and culture. Through this journey of explorations, the question of what it means to be ‘human’ stands at the very core of my work. Exploring how designers and artists can use objects, stories and technologies to question and challenge the long established dichotomies between the body and the environment, the self and the other, as well as external and internal truths. I hope that these spaces can become a catalyst for collectively redefining our relationship with our emotional, social and material reality.
